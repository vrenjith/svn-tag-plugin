svn-tag-plugin
==============

This plugin automatically performs subversion tagging (technically speaking svn copy) on successful build. This is useful when you want to access the stable codebase. The Subversion Plugin has support for manually tagging a particular build via Hudson's user interface. This plugin is for automatic tagging as part of the build.
